## Description
This directory contains scripts for different feature calculation and selection methods (Chi-square-AMINO, Fisher-AMINO, BPSO, and MPSO). The AMINO (Automatic Mutual Information Noise Omission) algorithm was developed by Ravindra, Smith, and Tiwary (Mol. Syst. Des. Eng., 2020,5, 339-348. https://doi.org/10.1039/C9ME00115H).

## Usage
**Prerequisites**:

from sklearn.feature_selection import f_classif
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import gc
import seaborn as sns
import multiprocessing
import kneed
import fisher_score_mod as fsm (in directory)

**BPSO.py**:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.svm import SVC, LinearSVC
from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier
from niapy.problems import Problem

**MPSO.py**:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.svm import SVC, LinearSVC
from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier
from niapy.problems import Problem
from niapy.task import Task
from niapy.algorithms.basic import ParticleSwarmOptimization

**Installation**: 

**Chi-Sq-AMINO.ipynb** and **Fisher-AMINO.ipynb**:

pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib.pyplot
pip install skfeature-chappers
pip install gc-python-utils
pip install seaborn
pip install xgboost
pip install kneed

**BPSO.py**:

pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install niapy

**MPSO.py**:

pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install niapy

**Running the Code**: 

1. **Chi-Sq-AMINO.ipynb**:

Edit the user inputs if you are using your own system. You can keep them the same if you are using our input data.
If you are using our input data, our system is MFSD2A, where the metastable states are 0: OFS, 1: OcS, and 2: IFS.
Make sure to edit the varThresh and nFeat as calculated by the script using the Kneedle Algorithm (reference: "Finding a 'Kneedle' in a Haystack: Detecting Knee Points in System Behavior").
Please note that the code might export intermediate text files/figures/PNGs/CSVs. However, the final output is called chi_amino_df.csv. 

2. **Fisher-AMINO.ipynb**:

Edit the user inputs if you are using your own system. You can keep them the same if you are using our input data.
If you are using our input data, our system is MFSD2A, where the metastable states are 0: OFS, 1: OcS, and 2: IFS.
Make sure to edit the varThresh and nFeat as calculated by the script using the Kneedle Algorithm (reference: "Finding a 'Kneedle' in a Haystack: Detecting Knee Points in System Behavior").
Please note that the code might export intermediate text files/figures/PNGs/CSVs. However, the final output is called fisher_amino_df.csv. 

3. **BPSO.py**:

Edit the user inputs if you are using your own system. You can keep them the same if you are using our input data.
The code template can be found in the tutorial provided on the NiaPy website: https://niapy.org/en/stable/tutorials/feature_selection.html. 
Adjust the BPSO parameters according to your needs by referring to the API documentation (https://niapy.org/en/stable/api/index.html#api-documentation). Note that we run BPSO iteratively until we obtain the final reduced feature set. 

4. **MPSO.py**:

Edit the user inputs if you are using your own system. You can keep them the same if you are using our input data.
Adjust the MPSO parameters according to your needs by referring to the API documentation (https://niapy.org/en/stable/api/index.html#api-documentation) and our paper. Note that we run MPSO iteratively until we obtain the final reduced feature set.
