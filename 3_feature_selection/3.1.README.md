## Description
This directory contains scripts for different feature calculation and selection methods (Chi-square-AMINO, Fisher-AMINO, BPSO, and MPSO). The AMINO (Automatic Mutual Information Noise Omission) algorithm was developed by Ravindra, Smith, and Tiwary (Mol. Syst. Des. Eng., 2020,5, 339-348. https://doi.org/10.1039/C9ME00115H).

**Running the Code**: 

1. **Chi-Sq-AMINO.ipynb**:

Edit the user inputs if you are using your own system. You can keep them the same if you are using our input data.
If you are using our input data, our system is MFSD2A, where the metastable states are 0: OFS, 1: OcS, and 2: IFS.
Make sure to edit the varThresh and nFeat as calculated by the script using the Kneedle Algorithm (reference: "Finding a 'Kneedle' in a Haystack: Detecting Knee Points in System Behavior").
Please note that the code might export intermediate text files/figures/PNGs/CSVs. However, the final output is called chi_amino_df.csv. 

2. **Fisher-AMINO.ipynb**:

Edit the user inputs if you are using your own system. You can keep them the same if you are using our input data.
If you are using our input data, our system is MFSD2A, where the metastable states are 0: OFS, 1: OcS, and 2: IFS.
Make sure to edit the varThresh and nFeat as calculated by the script using the Kneedle Algorithm (reference: "Finding a 'Kneedle' in a Haystack: Detecting Knee Points in System Behavior").
Please note that the code might export intermediate text files/figures/PNGs/CSVs. However, the final output is called fisher_amino_df.csv. 

3. **BPSO.py**:

Edit the user inputs if you are using your own system. You can keep them the same if you are using our input data.
The code template can be found in the tutorial provided on the NiaPy website: https://niapy.org/en/stable/tutorials/feature_selection.html. 
Adjust the BPSO parameters according to your needs by referring to the API documentation (https://niapy.org/en/stable/api/index.html#api-documentation). Note that we run BPSO iteratively until we obtain the final reduced feature set. 

4. **MPSO.py**:

Edit the user inputs if you are using your own system. You can keep them the same if you are using our input data.
Adjust the MPSO parameters according to your needs by referring to the API documentation (https://niapy.org/en/stable/api/index.html#api-documentation) and our paper. Note that we run MPSO iteratively until we obtain the final reduced feature set.
