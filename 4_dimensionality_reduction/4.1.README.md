## Description
This directory contains scripts for different dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, FLDA, MHLDA, ZHLDA, GDHLDA).

## Usage

**Prerequisites**: 

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize

**Installation**: 

pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn

**Running the Code**: 

Edit the user inputs if you are using your own system. You can keep them the same if you are using our input data.
If you are using our input data, our system is MFSD2A, where the metastable states are 0: OFS, 1: OcS, and 2: IFS.
Please note that all the LDA codes could be simplified (e.g., using the scikit-learn library). However, they were written from scratch.
