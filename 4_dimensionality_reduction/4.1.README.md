## Description
This directory contains scripts for different dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, FLDA, MHLDA, ZHLDA, GDHLDA).

## Usage

**Prerequisites**: 

import pandas as pd <br>
import numpy as np <br>
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA <br>
from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize <br>

**Installation**: 

pip install pandas <br>
pip install numpy <br>
pip install scikit-learn <br>

**Running the Code**: 

Edit the user inputs if you are using your own system. You can keep them the same if you are using our input data.
If you are using our input data, our system is MFSD2A, where the metastable states are 0: OFS, 1: OcS, and 2: IFS.
Please note that all the LDA codes could be simplified (e.g., using the scikit-learn library). However, they were written from scratch.
