## Description
This directory contains all the inputs required for the following steps in the code.

## Recommendation
Please refer to the paper for descriptions of the MFSD2A protein system and its metastable states (OFS, OcS, and IFS).

## Usage 
This is a sample dataset (obtained by striding 100 steps from our larger MFSD2A dataset, as referenced in the paper).
Therefore, the results may not align precisely with those presented in the paper. 
This dataset is intended to demonstrate how to execute the pipeline rather than to provide biological conclusions.
The dataset is designed to illustrate the availability of protocols, data, and workflows, enabling others to utilize the findings effectively. 
Ensure that the workflow is used correctly with the provided files, as done in this work.
The data was generated using OpenMM MD simulations, as described in the paper (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.19.590308v1) 

The dataset contains six files in total: three PSF files (protein structure information) and three DCD files (trajectories):

1. OFS.psf

2. OcS.psf

3. IFS.psf

4. sample_IFS_trajectory.dcd

5. sample_OcS_trajectory.dcd

6. sample_OFS_trajectory.dcd
